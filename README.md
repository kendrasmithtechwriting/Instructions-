## Instructions that Work Well versus Instructions that Do Not
Instructions that work well for me are instructions that are clear and concise. They explain exactly what to do, how to do them, and then maybe even provide an example. As a visual learner, I need to be able to see what I am supposed to  be doing and  how I need to do it.

Instructions that don’t work well for me are instructions that are vague or don’t provide a lot of background or explanation. For example if it says "draw a symbol next to everything that is functional, and draw another symbol for everything unique", then I feel as if I need a definition of functional and unique in accordance to the guidelines or topic relating.
